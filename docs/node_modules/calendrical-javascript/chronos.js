	 *	2. 	The same names shall be used for the "coeff" and the "canvas" properties, otherwise functions shall give erroneous results.

	 * (number, required) originWeekday: weekday number of day index 0. Value is renormalised to 0..weekLength-1.
	 * (function, required) daysInYear: function (year), number of days in year (using relative counting system). With solar calendars, result is 365 or 366.
	 * (number, required) startOfWeek: number of the first day of the week for this calendar, e.g. 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday etc. Default is 1. Value is renormalised to 0..weekLength-1.
	 * (number) characWeekNumber: number of the week of the characDayIndex. Default is 1.
	 * (number) dayBase: number of the first day in any week. May differ from startOfWeek. used for displaying result. Default is 1.
	 * (number) weekBase: number of the first week in any year. May differ from characWeekNumber. Default is 1.
	 * (number) weekLength: number of days in week. Usage: test alernate weeks. Default is 7.
	 * (boolean) weekReset: whether weekday is forced to a constant value at beginning of year. Default is false.
	 * (Array) uncappedWeeks: an array of the numbers of the week that have one or more day above weekLength. Possible cases:
		 undefined (and set to null): all weeks have always same duration.
		 .length = 1: last complete week of year is followed by several epagomenal days. These days are attached to the last week and hold numbers above weekLength
		 .length > 1: each week indentified is followed by one (unique) epagomenal day, and this week has weekLength + 1 days.
		 e.g. for French revolutionary calendar: [36], and the days are indexed indexed 10 to 15 (index of Décadi is 9);
		 whereas for ONU projected calendar: [26, 52], the Mondial day in the middle of year and the Bissextile day at the very end.
		 These days are only considered if weekReset is true, and in this case, uncappedWeeks should at least have one value.
	 * Non tested constraints: 
	 * 1. characWeekNumber shall be at beginning of year, before any intercalary month or day.

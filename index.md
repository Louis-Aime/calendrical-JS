## Demonstrator usage
With the first panel, choose a custom calendar, then enter a date in this calendar. 
If you use the "historic" calendar, you can specify the switching day to Gregorian.
With the next panels, specify the display options. You may choose a Unicode built-in calendar.
The date projected are displayed in the last panels.
The first panel also shows the week figures, with which you can specify a date.

# General calendrical routines for JavaScript
From this site (https://louis-aime.github.io/calendrical-javascript/) you can test the calendrical routines tools, 
including the extensions of Date and of Intl.DateTimeFormat, 
and compare their results with those of the standard objects.

## Documentation
Link to the [JSDoc generated documentation] (https://louis-aime.github.io/calendrical-javascript/index)

## Demonstrator usage
With the first panel, choose a custom calendar, then enter a date in this calendar. 
If you use the "historic" calendar, you can specify the switching day to Gregorian.
With the next panels, specify the display options. You may choose a Unicode built-in calendar.
The date projected are displayed in the last panels.
The first panel also shows the week figures, with which you can specify a date.
